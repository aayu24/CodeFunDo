F.A.R - First App Responders(#Android App)

Natural disasters claim the lives of thousands of people around every year around the globe.  With our F.A.R app, our aim is to reach as many people as possible in these unfortunate situation.

Our Application functionality is divided under Two sections:

- Predicting the disasters using Machine learning methods.
- A chatbot for helping the people and guiding them through, providing survival tips, appropriate helpline numbers etc.

For the prediction part …  
We will train a ResNet model with a multiclass classification algorithm to predict the chances of a natural disaster occuring in the near future. The model will be trained on a collection of satellite images. If the predicted likelihood of a natural disaster crosses a certain threshold, the app will send an alert to the concerned authorities as well as some NGO’s. This will allow for better preparedness and through NGO's more people can be aided through relief efforts.  

For the Chatbot part, we will use YAML scripts and implement them using Javascript. The chatbot will be able to answer the most basic of queries and will be able to provide some of the basic informative resources required in the event of a natural disaster even if the user is offline. The aim is to reduce the anxiety of the people and help them to become aware of all the possible ways that they can help themselves and others.
